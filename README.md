Purpose of application:
  This App will be a messaging app where users can make posts about anything to a global board. Users will have to login which will require a database to store their 
  credentials. Once logged in they will see the main board and will be able to read and see what users have posted. Users will be able to make posts 
  to the board by clicking on too another “view” and fill out the field with what they would like to say. Much like a twitter or a Instagram type of app.
  Once they hit send/post it will store that post in a data base, so that other people can pull that data and see the post. 
  There will be a log out button that will take the user back to the login screen/ “view”.
