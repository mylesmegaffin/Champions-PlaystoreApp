Upgrades since Assignment 2:
	• Launcher Icon has been replaced
	• Added Deployment Assets into the Project
	• Updated and Stream lined the Navigation around the App
	• Fixed FAB's
	• Added Styling to the App that fits with the overall theme
	• Added Required Auth on some Pages


Purpose of application:
This App will be an app where you can log in and look up different league of legends champions to see what ability’s they have (each champion has 5 ability’s). 
With all 130+ champions, I think there will be plenty of data. 

Identifying:
•	How to access a DB 

•	How to create a login screen

•	How to hide the data of the champions until the user is authenticated

•	How to save data to a DB

•	How to pull data from DB

•	How to switch views

•	How to make a Recycler view

•	How to input all the data

•	How to set up an item view

(lot of DB access)
