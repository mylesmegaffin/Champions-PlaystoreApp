Purpose of application:
This App will be an app where you can log in and look up different league of legends champions to see what ability’s they have (each champion has 5 ability’s). 
With all 130+ champions, I think there will be plenty of data. 

Identifying:
•	How to access a DB
•	How to create a login screen
•	How to hide the data of the champions until the user is authenticated
•	How to save data to a DB
•	How to pull data from DB
•	How to switch views
•	How to make a Recycler view
•	How to input all the data
•	How to set up an item view

(lot of DB access)
